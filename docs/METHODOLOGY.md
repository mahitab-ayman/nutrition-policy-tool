3. **Feature Engineering**: Creation of derived variables and composite indices
4. **Data Merging**: Joining datasets on common keys (country, region, date)
5. **Quality Validation**: Automated checks for data consistency and completeness

#### 2.3 Synthetic Data Generation

For demonstration purposes, the tool generates synthetic data that mimics real-world patterns:

- **Temporal Patterns**: Seasonal variations and long-term trends
- **Geographic Variation**: Regional differences in nutrition and food security
- **Demographic Factors**: Age, rural/urban, poverty level variations
- **Correlation Structure**: Realistic relationships between variables

### 3. Machine Learning Methodology

#### 3.1 Model Architecture

The tool employs an ensemble approach combining multiple algorithms:

**Base Models:**
- **Random Forest**: Handles non-linear relationships and provides feature importance
- **Gradient Boosting**: Captures complex patterns with high accuracy
- **Logistic Regression**: Provides interpretable baseline predictions
- **Support Vector Machine**: Handles high-dimensional data effectively

**Ensemble Method:**
- **Voting Classifier**: Combines predictions from multiple models
- **Soft Voting**: Uses probability scores for more nuanced predictions
- **Model Selection**: Automatically selects best performing model based on cross-validation

#### 3.2 Feature Engineering

**Nutrition Features:**
- Protein, Vitamin A, Iron, Zinc, Calcium, Vitamin D adequacy scores
- Overall nutrition composite score
- Nutrient-specific risk indicators

**Food Security Features:**
- Food availability, access, utilization, and stability indices
- Market access and price indicators
- Climate and agricultural factors

**Demographic Features:**
- Population density and distribution
- Rural/urban percentages
- Poverty rates and income levels
- Age group distributions

**Derived Features:**
- Vulnerability score (composite of multiple risk factors)
- Climate stress index (temperature and rainfall variations)
- Market stress index (price and access variations)
- Overall risk score (weighted combination of all factors)

#### 3.3 Model Training Process

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Feature selection using statistical tests (ANOVA F-test)
   - Missing value imputation using median values
   - Feature scaling using StandardScaler
   - Train-test split (80-20) with stratification

2. **Model Training:**
   - 5-fold cross-validation for robust performance estimation
   - Hyperparameter optimization using grid search
   - Early stopping to prevent overfitting
   - Model performance comparison and selection

3. **Validation:**
   - Cross-validation scores (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
   - ROC-AUC analysis for classification performance
   - Feature importance analysis for interpretability
   - Out-of-sample prediction validation

#### 3.4 Target Variable Definition

**High Risk Classification:**
- Threshold: Overall risk score > 0.6
- Based on composite of nutrition, food security, and demographic factors
- Binary classification: High Risk (1) vs. Low Risk (0)

**Risk Score Calculation:**
```
Overall Risk Score = 
  (Vulnerability Score × 0.3) +
  (Nutrition Risk Score × 0.4) +
  (Climate Stress Index × 0.2) +
  (Market Stress Index × 0.1)
```

### 4. Intervention Simulation
